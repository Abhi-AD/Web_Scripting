# BeautifulSoup Web Scraping Project

This project demonstrates web scraping using Python's BeautifulSoup library.

## Setup

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Abhi-AD/Web_Scripting.git
    cd Web_Scripting
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required packages**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

   If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you can install the necessary libraries directly:
    ```bash
    pip install beautifulsoup4 requests
    ```

## Run

To run the web scraping script, use the following command:

```bash
python scrape.py
```
